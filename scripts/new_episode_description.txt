This episode is both experimental and transitional, blending creativity and reflection in unexpected ways. It includes a captivating short story, an anonymous message to the world, and an entry from Burning Man 2024 featuring contributions from Wayne DeFehr, Danica Hoffart, Trevor DePagie, and LR Friberg. You'll also hear unreleased music by Pete Swinton alongside tracks from Black Saturn and Jon Shuemaker. And, as always, expect to encounter at least two synthetic voices throughout the experience.
